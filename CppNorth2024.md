# **CPPNorth2024!**

## July 21-24 2024

It's my thrid year at CppNorth! Woohoo!! 
The organizers are so awesome, every year they make it even more memorable! Such a wide and diverse group of people that all love programming, once again, it's been a blast!

Let's go!

## Travel

This time I took my car to drive from Montr√©al on the Sunday. My family is going to join my on wednesday (by train!) so we can enjoy Tonroto a bit, and even Niagara falls, cool!

It all went very smooth so I could practice my talk during the 6 hour drive, but had a hard time trying to find an 'oppening statement' that would do justice to the rest of the talk...hehe... 
we'll see in the video if it sent well, I think I forgot to say "Fasten your seat belts as we're going to have a heck of a ride!" (I usually talk a little too fast, hehe)
